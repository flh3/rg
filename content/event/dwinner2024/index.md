This dissertation examined trauma-informed
schools from the perspective of school social workers, addressing the limited empirical research on whole-school trauma-informed approaches. Using survey data from 538 social workers, Studies 1 and 2 identified key practices, policies, and climate characteristics associated with schools perceived as trauma informed. Study 1 found that trauma training and resources for secondary traumatic stress predicted trauma-informed identification, while Study 2 showed that safer, strengths-based, equitable, and collaborative school climates were also key indicators. Study 3, based on interviews with 20 social workers, revealed that trauma-informed schools are understood as holistic, systemic environments that extend beyond training or clinical services. Collectively, the findings highlight the need for social workers to lead institutional change, address inequities, and support support sustainable trauma-informed practices in schools.
